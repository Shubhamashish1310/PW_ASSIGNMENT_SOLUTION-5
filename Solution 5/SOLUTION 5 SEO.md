# Favicon Definition and Example

A **favicon** (short for "favorite icon") is a small, square-shaped image typically used to represent a website or web page. It appears in various places, including the browser's tab, bookmarks, and sometimes in search results. Favicons help users quickly identify and differentiate between multiple open tabs or saved bookmarks.

## Example:

To add a favicon to your website, include the following code in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
